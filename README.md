## introduction
Information systems help small companies manage their data and improve how they work. For example, Mayil Foods, a Kerala-based food company, needs a system to manage products, orders, and customers efficiently. This project focuses on designing a basic information system with features like adding, viewing, updating, and deleting product and order details (CRUD operations). Such a system will help Mayil Foods keep their business organized and serve their customers better.
# goal
The goal of this project is to design and develop a basic information system for a small organisation, such as Mayil Foods, to help them manage their business data more efficiently. The system will focus on implementing core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing key data like products, customers, tracking history and orders. This project aims to demonstrate how technology can simplify business operations, improve data accuracy, and support better decision-making by providing a proof-of-concept application tailored to the organisationâ€™s needs.
